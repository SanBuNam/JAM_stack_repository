        <p>
          As Software Developer I helped assess the charityâ€™s digital estate of
          more than 12 websites built with different technologies. I was later
          involved in their digital transformation moving from Drupal to Adobe
          Experience Manager. This involved architectural decisions and
          providing technical guidance and impartial advice. I was also in
          charge of a security project. Leading a team of 5 experienced Drupal
          developers we secured sites and servers, and I put processes in place
          to accommodate the charities future requirements for a scalable and
          secure platform.
