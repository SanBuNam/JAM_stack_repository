In this day and age where digital technology and the Internet has influenced how we live and work, it is shocking to know that very few small business owners have a website.

It is hard to believe that only <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271068" target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange"><span style="color:orange">46% of small businesses</span></a> have a website. This statistic is confounding when you realize people spend <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271068" target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange"><span style="color:orange">6 hours a day</span></a> on the Internet.

Based on 2014 survey results, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271068" target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange"><span style="color:orange">41% of small business owners</span></a> reported they don’t think they need a website. What that means is they probably don’t know the benefits of having a website for their small business.

## 1. Improve Business Credibility.

A simple way to view a website is that it is your online business address. This is where your customers, clients and associates go to find you on the Internet.

The Home page identifies your branded value proposition, the About Us page tells visitors all about your business and the Contact Us page informs everyone how to get in touch with you.

It legitimizes your business and improves your credibility. It gives your business an identity and is virtual proof that it exists.

Don’t be mislead into thinking a company page in Facebook is enough to build your credibility. A 2015 survey showed that 84% of consumers believe that having a website makes your business more credible than just a social media page.

Having a website means you have your own domain. In the same survey, 65% of respondents regards a company-branded e-mail as more credible than a generic one.

## 2. Build Your Business.

Before broadband technology became widespread in 2004, websites were used primarily for marketing and informational purposes. A website functioned more like a brochure; you put one up to stay ahead of the competition. But there wasn’t much thought and purpose behind the content.

With the growth of the Internet, the influence of social media and the popularity of mobile devices, the website has become a crucial tool to build your business.

- <span style="color:orange">**Share Your Story**</span> – According to Nobel Prize winning psychiatrist Daniel Kahneman, <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2013/12/07/nothing-more-than-feelings" target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange"><span style="color:orange">consumers patronize brands</span></a> they can align their values with.

A website is a great way to share your story; tell your audience why you started this business, your goals and what you hope to accomplish with it.

- <span style="color:orange">**Get Clients**</span> – It’s not enough to have a rock star online profile. 36% of clients prefer to <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/34-of-consumers-think-a-smart-website-gives-a-local-business-more-credibility/" target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:orange"><span style="color:orange">deal with businesses</span></a> that have websites. By contrast, only 21% will work with businesses without websites.

A website gives you the platform to highlight your experience and expertise.

- <span style="color:orange">**Find Your Team**</span> – Are you looking for people to help you run your business?

Set up a Career page in your website where prospective candidates can fill out an application form and attach their resume. Post your job requirement in social media and link it back to your website. You should have a good number of candidates in no time!

## 3. Enhance Your Online Presence.

Here’s a statistical fact that will blow your mind:

Of the 7.4 Billion people in this world, 3.5 Billion people or 47% are online every day. They are searching for information, sharing on social media or shopping on e-commerce websites.

This number is expected to grow as the world becomes increasingly dependent on mobile technology to search the Internet. Today there are an estimated 2.3 Billion smartphones worldwide. But in 2020, the total number of smartphones is expected to hit 6.1 Billion.

If your small business does not have a website, you will be undermining its ability to generate income. And not just any website; but a mobile responsive website, one that can be accessed by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Statistically, 65% of online traffic comes from mobile devices.

A mobile responsive website will help you capitalize on the opportunities available on the Internet through the following ways:

- <span style="color:orange">**Improve Search Rankings**</span> – By optimizing your web pages, it will be easier for people to find your content.

- <span style="color:orange">**Distribute Content**</span> – Create relevant, unique and usable content and distribute them through different channels such as social media and blog sites. People who love your content would want to know more about you and visit your website.

- <span style="color:orange">**Open 24/7**</span> – Unlike a brick- and- mortar business that operates 9- to- 5, a website never closes shop. It is open 24/7, even on holidays.

* <span style="color:orange">**Introduce Business Flexibility**</span> – If you don’t want to miss out on opportunities, outsource customer service and have your agents manage all concerns and inquiries via chat or e-mail support at your website.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
    impassive fruitlessly shut

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

> The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
> been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
> would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
> return to its own, safe country.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
